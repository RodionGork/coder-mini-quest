Quick siberian summer of 1948 is nearing its end.
Expedition is over. You as its leader have traced routes to
a dozen new tops and supervised construction of geodetic marks
and observation places upon them. Even most of measurements are
already completed. Only at few of the farthest peaks observers
are to work for a week more.

This day an airplane should be called
to take your group back to civilization. Later in the winter months
all collected data would be carefully processed to create precise
map of this poorly known region. Perhaps in few more years new
roads, mines, bridges, factories and cities will appear here,
young and enthusiastic people will come to live in this austere
but beautiful land - all thanks to this summer's efforts of your comrades...

Ok, it's time to (#147 leave the tent) anyway.
