This spring, after snow have left the mountain tops, construction
group erected there on the Yambooy's top new mark and concrete pyramid
for setting precise instruments there.
--
The group went back down to the
main camp at Rekanda river. Sergey Petrik remained here with
another worker just for one more day to remove the wooden formwork
and cover the pyramid with plaster.
--
That second worker, awoke in the morning but haven't found
Petrik either in the tent or on the top. Supposing his comrade left for
the main camp due to some reason, worker had finished the pyramid and went
down too. But others here haven't seen the fellow either. People waited for
a day, then searched all around - lakes and marshes - to no avail.
Now Evtushenko gone missing there too.
