# coder-mini-quest

Small text quest with programming exercises. This open-source project is created
intentionally to give people an opportunity to participate in something
simple and open-source.

Please have a look into [Contributer's Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### How it works

Look at the [Live Demo](https://project-ioffe.sourceforge.io/quest.html) - try
playing a bit with it. Then look into source files.

Here is `index.html` which contains browser javascript to drive the game.

Also here is `cgi-bin/x.cgi` - server-side script, which responds to browser
requests and serves files from `cgi-bin/dat` with textual descriptions you
see when playing and also runs the scripts providing programming exercises.

We shall add more detailed explanation later.
